# STREAMLIT_HANDY (MÃOZINHA) - Offensive Gesture Detector 👋🚫

**STREAMLIT_HANDY** is a tool that uses **streamlit** to detect the presence of a hand in an image or video automatically via a web platform. Furthermore, it uses another pre-trained model (which will be mentioned later) to perform the classification and check for the existence of an offensive gesture, specifically the middle finger gesture.
This project is a fun and interesting way to explore the power of computer vision and real-time gesture detection. Let's help you set up and run **STREAMLIT_HANDY** in your environment.

## Prerequisites 📋

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed in your development environment:

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)
- streamlit
- opencv-python
- keras
- tensorflow
- scipy
- numpy
- nltk
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- mediapipe

## How to Run 🏃‍♀️

Follow these simple steps to set up and run HANDY:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/BIRDRED/streamlit_handy.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```shell
   cd handy
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run STREAMLIT-HANDY**

   ```shell
	streamlit run streamlit1.py
   ```

   Now you should see the live camera window with hand detection and offensive gesture classification.
